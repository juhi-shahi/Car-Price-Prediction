🚗 Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression
A beginner-friendly yet effective machine learning project that estimates car prices based on key attributes using Linear Regression. Perfect for data science learners and auto enthusiasts who want hands-on experience in regression modeling, feature engineering, and evaluation.

🎯 Project Objective
Predict the selling price of a used car based on key specifications such as engine capacity, mileage, and transmission type. This project walks through the complete machine learning workflow:

📊 Building a Linear Regression model

🧹 Data cleaning and preprocessing

🤖 Predicting prices for new/unseen car entries

⚙️ Tech Stack
Python (v3.7+)

Pandas, NumPy – Data handling

Scikit-learn – Linear Regression & preprocessing

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualizations

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive analysis

🧪 Sample Prediction
Example of predicting a car’s price using the trained model:

python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd

# Sample input data
input_data = pd.DataFrame(
    [[4, 2024, 30000, 2, 1, 1, 1, 21.1, 814, 52.8, 9.0]],
    columns=[
        'name', 'year', 'km_driven', 'fuel', 'seller_type',
        'transmission', 'owner', 'mileage', 'engine', 'max_power', 'seats'
    ]
)

# Predict the price
predicted_price = model.predict(input_data)
print(f"Predicted Price: ₹{predicted_price[0]:,.2f}")
🖥 Output:
Predicted Price: ₹496,290.89
📈 Model Performance
Metric	Value (Example)
Model	Linear Regression

Example Output	₹496,000+
